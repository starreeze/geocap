# Task:
You are provided with a description of a fossil image. For numerical values appearing in the numerical information, replace the corresponding values in the description with those from the numerical information. 2 examples are provided to help you understand the task.

# Requirements:
1. Replace any approximate values in the description with the exact values provided
2. Replace any ranges with the exact numerical value provided and do not use word like 'varies from'
3. Keep the original descriptive language intact where no numerical values are involved
4. Maintain the scientific tone and accuracy of the description
5. Your response should contain only a modified description, without any additional analysis or using any brackets for additional explanations.
6. For sequence numbers in the numerical information, including thickness by volution, heights of volution/whorl, and tunnel angles, ensure that the processed description includes these sequence numbers in the corresponding feature sections if they are given.
7. Try to fix some errors in the description after replacing the numerical values.

## Examples:
### Description:
Shell large, elongate fusiform, with strongly curved axis of coiling and bluntly pointed poles; mature specimens have about 9.5 volutions, and measure 13.00 to 13.40 mm. in length and 3.10 to 3.40 mm. in diameter; first 4 whorls tightly coiled with sharply pointed poles, after which coiling becomes looser; form ratio varies from 3.82 to 4.32.  \nSpirotheca composed of tectum and coarsely alveolar keriotheca; thin in early volutions, and thickening rather abruptly at about beginning of 5th whorl; in 8th volution it measures 101 to 127 \u03bc in thickness. Septa nearly plane in tightly coiled early volutions, becoming strongly fluted in more loosely coiled ones; septa folds high, commonly reaching tops of chambers.  \nProloculus moderate in size, its outside diameter varying from 166 to 265 \u03bc, averaging about 203 \u03bc. Tunnel moderately wide; in 8th volution tunnel angle measures 37\u00b0 to 45\u00b0. Low, narrow chomata present except in outermost whorls.

### Processed description:
Shell large, elongate fusiform, with strongly curved axis of coiling and bluntly pointed poles; mature specimens have about 4.5 volutions, and measure 12.067 mm. in length and 3.828 mm. in diameter; first few whorls tightly coiled with sharply pointed poles, after which coiling becomes looser; height of volutions in the first to fifth volutions averages 288, 277, 492, 316 microns; form ratio 3.152.  \nSpirotheca composed of tectum and coarsely alveolar keriotheca; thin in early volutions, and thickening rather abruptly at later ones; thickness of spirotheca of the first to fifth volutions averages 39, 37, 37, 56, 64 microns. Septa nearly plane in tightly coiled early volutions, becoming strongly fluted in more loosely coiled ones; septa folds high, commonly reaching tops of chambers.  \nProloculus moderate in size, its outside diameter 140 \u03bc. Tunnel moderately wide. Low, narrow chomata present except in outermost whorls.

### Description:
Test fusiform to elongate fusiform. Length of mature forms is from 6 mm. to 8 mm. with a width of up to 3 mm., giving a mature form ratio of between 2 and 3. Mature forms have eight volutions in which the septa are uniformly and highly fluted throughout the length of the test. Septa are uniform in height, all nearly four-fifths the height of the chamber, with few or none in contact with the adjacent wall. The diameter of the proloculus varies from 0.145 mm. to 0.185 mm., with an average of 0.160 mm. The wall is of average thickness for the genus, from 0.018 mm. in the first volution to about 0.045 mm. in the sixth volution. The tunnel angle is irregular and varies considerably. Average tunnel angles are from about 20\u00b0 in the third volution to about 25\u00b0 in the sixth volution, with tunnel angles ranging from extremes of 16\u00b0 to 38\u00b0. Chomata show considerable variation in individual specimens, ranging from well-defined ridges to irregular deposits upon the septa.
