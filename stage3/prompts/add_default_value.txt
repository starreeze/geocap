# Task:
You are provided with a description of a fossil image with different features wrapped with <feature> and </feature> tags. Your task is to add default feature descriptions for any missing features according to the specifications below.

# Requirements
1. Add the following default feature descriptions ONLY if they are missing from the input:
   - shape: "<shape>fusiform,</shape>"
   - equator: "<equator>equatorial portion inflated,</equator>"
   - lateral slopes: "<lateral slopes>lateral slopes straight,</lateral slopes>"
   - poles: "<poles>with rounded poles</poles>"
   - axis: "<axis>Coiling axis straight</axis>"
   - coil tightness: "<coil tightness>inner volutions are more tightly coiled than outer ones</coil tightness>"
   - septa: "<septa>Septa straight</septa>"
   - chomata: "<chomata>Chomata absent</chomata>"
   - axial filling: "<axial filling>Axial filling absent</axial filling>"
   - tunnel shape: "<tunnel shape>Tunnel regular with moderate width and height</tunnel shape>"
   - endothyroid: "<endothyroid>Endothyroid coiling in the inner whorls not observed</endothyroid>"

2. If all required features are already present in the input description (even with different content), return the input description unchanged
