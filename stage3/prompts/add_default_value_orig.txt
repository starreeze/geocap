# Task:
You are provided with a description of a fossil image. Your task is to add default feature descriptions for any missing features according to the specifications below.

# Requirements
1. Add the following default feature descriptions ONLY if they are missing from the input:
   - shape: "fusiform,"
   - equator: "equatorial portion inflated,"
   - lateral slopes: "lateral slopes straight,"
   - poles(extremities): "poles rounded"
   - axis: "Coiling axis straight"
   - coil tightness: "inner volutions are more tightly coiled than outer ones"
   - septa(septal folding): "Septa straight"
   - chomata: "Chomata absent"
   - axial filling: "Axial filling absent"
   - tunnel shape: "Tunnel regular with moderate width and height"
   - endothyroid: "Endothyroid coiling in the inner whorls not observed"

2. Insert missing features at appropriate locations in the description:
   - Place "axis" near shell description if missing
   - Add other missing features near the end of the description or near related features
   - Maintain the original flow and structure of the text

3. If all required features are already present in the input description (even with different content), return the input description unchanged, and do not add any additional explanation.

# Examples:
## Input description:
Test large, rhomboidal in shape, with one side concave and the other convex; median axis undulating, terminating in sharp extremities. Volutions numbering 6.0; initial volutions tightly coiled, becoming progressively looser outward. Volution heights for first to sixth whorls averaging 225, 179, 213, 317, 259 microns. Holotype dimensions 10.802 mm in length, 3.179 mm in width, axial ratio approximately 3.398:1. Spirotheca extremely thin in tightly coiled inner whorls; thickness measurements for first to sixth volutions averaging 25, 51, 43, 42, 45, 46 microns. Septa planar and straight in inner whorls, becoming fully fluted externally; flutings broadly rounded, occasionally extending to chamber tops. Chomata minute, observable only in inner volutions. Tunnels shallow, moderately broad; tunnel angles measuring approximately 39\u00b0 (1st), 32\u00b0 (2nd), 70\u00b0 (3rd), 56\u00b0 (4th), 62\u00b0 (5th), 28\u00b0 (6th). Axial fillings dense, present along lateral sides of median axis except in final volution. Proloculus circular, external diameter 228 microns.

## Input description:
Shell diminutive, central section cylindrical with conical, acutely pointed extremities. Adult specimens exhibit 6.0 whorls; initial coils tightly wound and slender cylindrical; subsequent whorls more loosely arranged with equatorial expansion. Dimensions measure 6.468 mm length and 2.464 mm diameter. Form ratio 2.625. Spirotheca thickness in initial whorl 21 \u03bc. Septa nearly planar in tightly coiled inner whorls, becoming prominently fluted in outer whorls. Substantial secondary deposits occupying most extra-equatorial shell volume. Proloculus extremely small (external diameter 246 \u03bc). Tunnel low-profile and constricted. Thin chomata present in early whorls but lacking in later stages.

## Input description:
Fusiform tests of six to seven volutions commonly reach 2.5 mm. in length and 1.2 mm. in diameter. Proloculi average about 0.05 mm. in outside diameter. First volution low and nautiliform, commonly coiled at an angle to later volutions. Succeeding volutions gradually increase in height and length, particularly in outer one or two volutions. Nearly straight lateral slopes end in sharply rounded poles. Septa are gently undulate across chamber: folds are pronounced only in polar regions. Regular narrow tunnel is bordered by low massive chomata which become nearly tabular by the fifth or sixth volutions.

## Input description:
Test large, subcylindrical or highly elongate fusiform, with pointed axial ends. Ratio of length to diameter 2.8-3.5, more frequently 3.0. Test in the initial one or two whorls shortened, with a convex median region, in the succeeding whorls flattened. Surface with marked septal furrows, visible at the axial ends and along the undulations of the walls in the median region. Dimensions large: Length 5.18-7.47 mm.: diameter 1.73-2.11 mm. Number of whorls four and one-half to five, rarely up to six. Initial chamber large, 205-345\u03bc in diameter. Spire loosely coiled, expanding uniformly.  \nWall thin, its thickness 30-45\u03bc, not infrequently only 20-25\u03bc. Septa thin, of almost the same thickness as the wall. Septal folding strong and irregular, with a predominance of high and very narrow, sometimes closed folds. There are coarsely alveolar networks in a broad zone at the axial ends. Chomata sometimes observed in the first whorl; from the second whorl on, as a rule, they are absent and are replaced by weakly defined pseudochomata. Sometimes there is weak axial thickening in the early whorls.
