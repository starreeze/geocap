The average form ratio of three mature specimens is 2.1. Form ratios of the first to sixth volution are 1.4, 1.7, 2.0, 2.1, 2.1, and 2.0, respectively. The form ratio increases about uniformly for the first three to four volutions but increases only slightly, if at all, in the outer three volutions.\\n\"The proloculus is large, with outside diameter of 380 to 440 microns. Its thickness ranges from 26 to 41 microns. The expansion of the shell is about uniform during the first three volutions; during the fourth volution the height of the chambers increases rapidly, and from there to maturity the chambers decrease in height slowly. The outermost volution of mature specimens is relatively tightly coiled. The height of the first to seventh volution averages 116, 188, 244, 404, 564, 533, and 480 microns, respectively.\\n\"The spirotheca is relatively thick for the genus, but it changes in thickness with growth of the individual. The thickness of the spirotheca in the first to seventh volution averages 27, 38, 54, 75, 97, 105, and 103 microns, respectively. The spirotheca increases in thickness slowly with growth of the individual for the first four volutions, beyond which it increases in thickness rapidly but decreases in the outermost volution of mature specimens. The alveoli of the keriotheca are coarse but are poorly preserved in many parts. The proloculus wall is thick, averaging about 34 microns.\\n\"The septa are closely spaced in the inner four to five volutions, more widely spaced in the following two volutions. They are narrowly and highly fluted throughout the length of the shell. The folds of the septa are not uniform vertically, however, for axial sections may intersect the same fold at two points. The septa are thick in the area of the tunnel and are thin in the polar region.\\n\"The tunnel is broad and relatively high in the second and third before the last volution. Chomata are broad and high in the inner four volutions but low and discontinuous in outer volutions. The absence of distinct chomata makes it difficult to measure accurately the tunnel angle in the outer volutions. The average tunnel angles of the first to sixth volution are about 12, 11, 15, 23, 32, and 29 degrees, respectively."}

Quite often the axis of coiling is curved in the median region, so that the test has an accentuated flattening on one side and is convex on the other. L:D=2.50-3.04. Dimensions average: L=6.65-7.50 mm, D= 2.18-2.76 mm. Number of whorls constant -4 1/2-5 1/2.\\nProloculus spherical or a trifle flattened, 280-416 \u03bcm in diameter. Coiling even, diameter of fourth whorl varies between 1.80 and 2.50 mm. Wall with shallow septal grooves, rugose, rugosity shallow, begins in third whorl, sometimes even in second whorl. Wall thickness evenly increases from very little in the proloculus and first whorls to 80-100 \u03bcm in the mature test. Septa thin, much thinner than wall, forming an alveolar network at the poles and on the sides of the test shallow regular triangular low arches which get thicker toward their vertices. Arches reach half, sometimes even two thirds of the test height. Interrupted axial fillings in the second and third whorls fill the sides of the test. Chomata either completely absent or in the form of small tubercles are observed at the proloculus and in the first whorl. Aperture narrow in initial stage, strongly broadens in third to fourth whorl, decreasing in height from the juvenile whorls, where it equals two-thirds the chamber height, to half the whorl height in maturity."}

Its outside diameter measures about 430 to 500 microns. The shell expands essentially uniformly up to about the fifth volution. The chambers increase in height up to the fifth volution, but they decrease in height slightly from the fifth volution to maturity. The heights of the chambers in the first to the seventh volution are 108, 171, 242, 314, 342, 363, and 324 microns, respectively.\\nThe septa are relatively thick. They are distinctly pendant-shaped in cross-section, but the lower margins of the septa are distinctly thicker immediately over the tunnel than poleward from the tunnel. The septa are narrowly fluted throughout the length of the shell.\\nThe spirotheca is thick and composed of a tectum and keriotheca with coarse alveoli. The keriotheca has coarse alveoli in the first part of the first volution. Secondary deposits continuous with the chomata and axial fillings cover the upper surfaces of the spirotheca in most parts of the inner volutions, but thin sections of numerous specimens indicate that the porous structure of the keriotheca completely penetrates the spirotheca in the outer volutions. The thicknesses of the spirotheca in the first to the seventh volution are about 50, 70, 90, 110, 150, 150, and 150 microns, respectively.\\nThe tunnel is low and of medium width, and its path is straight. The tunnel angles of the second to the sixth volutions measure 20\u00b0, 20\u00b0, 22\u00b0, 24\u00b0, and 30\u00b0, respectively. Discontinuous irregular chomata border the tunnel in the second volution to the beginning part of the last volution."}

From the second to the fourth volution the shell increases in relative length slightly rapidly with the growth of individuals, but again decreases in the outer three to four volutions. Ratios of the half-length to the radius vector of the first to eighth volution are 1.2, 1.4, 1.4, 1.4, 1.2, 1.2, 1.2, and 1.1, respectively.\\nThe proloculus is spherical and rather large for the genus, with an outside diameter of 80-154 microns. The shell expands more or less slowly in the inner three to four volutions, and rapidly but almost uniformly from the fourth volution to maturity. Radius vector of the first to eighth volution are 115, 191, 198, 431, 626, 852, 1096, and 1331 microns, respectively. The heights of the chambers are almost uniform from the center of the shell to the poles.\\nThe spirotheca is relatively thick, consisting of a tectum, a diaphanotheca, and outer and inner tectoria. The clear diaphanotheca appears from the first volution and exists throughout the length of the shell. Both outer and inner tectoria are also well developed except in the last volution, where they usually are not present. Thickness of the diaphanotheca plus tectum of the second to eighth volution are 13, 16, 17, 22, 23, 23, and 26 microns, respectively.\\nThe septa are relatively closely spaced and are almost plane throughout the length of the shell. Almost all of the septa are coated by the secondary deposits which continue to the outer tectorium of the preceding whorl.\\nThe tunnel is about one-half as high as the chambers, and its path is rather irregular. Tunnel angles of the second to seventh volution are 17, 14, 16, 16, 13, and 15 degrees, respectively. The chomata are well developed from the second volution to the last one. The tunnel side of the chomata are very steep, vertical, or sometimes overhanging. The chomata extend almost the whole way to the poles in the inner volutions, but about half in the outer two to three volutions. No axial fillings present."}

The first volution is ellipsoidal in profile. The second to fifth volutions are inflated fusiform, and their axis of coiling increases in length. The outer volutions are highly elongate. Form ratios of the first to the seventh volution are 1.1, 1.6, 2.1, 2.8, 3.0, 3.5, and 3.7, respectively.\\nThe proloculus is small, and its outside diameter is 70 to 97 microns. The shell expands uniformly. Heights of the first to the eighth volution are 28, 39, 50, 69, 86, 122, 140, and 162 microns, respectively.\\nThe septa are broadly and highly fluted in the extreme polar regions. The fluting rapidly decreases, however, from the poles toward the tunnel. The septa are irregularly fluted or wavy in their basal parts poleward from the tunnel, but the fluting is not regularly spaced. The irregularity of the septal attitude may be due to the irregular shape of shell rather than true septal fluting.\\nThe spirotheca is relatively thin, but it is typical of the genus. Thicknesses of all layers of the spirotheca above the tunnel in the first to the seventh volution are about 8, 11, 14, 19, 23, 27, and 23 microns, respectively. The spirotheca changes in thickness only slightly poleward from the center of the shell. The wall of the proloculus is about 8 microns thick.\\nThe tunnel path is about straight. Tunnel angles of the third to the seventh volution are about 22, 26, 28, 34, and 48 degrees, respectively. The tunnel is almost circular in cross section in the inner two volutions. It increases in width rapidly from the second to the third volution. Chomata are asymmetrical. Their tunnel sides are almost vertical, and their poleward slopes are low. In the outer three volutions, the chomata are about three times as wide as high. In the second to fourth volutions, the chomata extend into the polar regions with rapidly decreasing height."}

Central portion of shell is inflated dome-like and lateral slopes convex. Number of volutions of mature shells is usually 5\u00bd to 6\u00bd, rarely 7\u00bd. Mature shells vary from 2.214 to 3.157 mm. in length and from 1.517 to 2.460 mm. in width. Form ratio is 1.4 to 1.6. Form ratio hardly increases from early volution to last. Form ratios of first to seventh volution are 1.0, 1.2, 1.2, 1.3, 1.3, 1.3, and 1.4, respectively.\\n\\\"Proloculus is large and spherical. Its outside diameter is 148 to 180 microns, and rarely 131 microns. Shell coils loosely and uniformly. Heights of chambers above tunnel in first to sixth volution are 33-82, 66-98, 82-131, 114-180, 98-230 and 180-262 microns, respectively. Chambers are essentially same in height poleward from tunnel. Spirotheca is thick and composed of a tectum, a diaphanotheca, and upper and lower tectoria. Diaphanotheca cannot be clearly observed in first volution, but appears clearly from second volution. Tectorium, especially lower tectorium becomes rapidly thick from third volution. Thickness of protheca of second to sixth volution is 4, 8, 12, 12, 20 and 25 microns, respectively. Septa are plane in central portions, but are irregularly fluted in extreme polar regions except for first volution. Septa are relatively closely spaced. Almost all of septa except for septa of a few outer chambers are coated thickly by secondary deposits which continue to inner tectorium of preceding and succeeding chambers. Tunnel is narrow and its path is somewhat irregular. Tunnel angles of first to seventh volution are 19, 18, 17, 20, 20, 23 and 26 degrees, respectively. Tunnel is about a half as high as chambers in almost all volutions. Chomata are well developed throughout shell except for last volition of some specimens. They are massive and asymmetrical. Tunnel sides of chomata are very steep, vertical, or sometimes overhanging. Poleward slopes are very gentle, extending nearly to poles in inner volutions. In outer volutions their poleward slopes become steep and their forms become often rectangular."}

In five specimens examined, proloculi range from 0.02 to 0.12 mm. in outside diameter. First volution is low and coiled askew to later volutions: succeeding volutions increase gradually in height and chambers tend to have a nearly constant height from mid-plane to pole. Lateral slopes are slightly concave and taper to sharply rounded poles. Four-layered fusulinellid wall has thin inner tectorium. Septa are folded near poles and undulate slightly across middle portion of chambers. Narrow regular tunnel is bordered by massive high chomata that are highly asymmetrical in early volutions and nearly tabular in outer one or two volutions."}

However, the anterior diaphanotheca is very indistinct and it cannot be recognized in the lower two-thirds of the septa. Most of the septa are rather poorly preserved near the tunnel. The septa are highly and rather narrowly fluted in the regions of the poles. Near the center of the shell of the outer volution the septa are very weakly fluted in their lower one-fourth.

Near the center of the tunnel of the sixth volution the upper tectorium is microns thick, the diaphanotheca is 8.7 microns thick, and the lower tectorium is 5.3 microns thick. The diaphanotheca thins rather rapidly poleward and it is not distinguishable in the regions of the poles."}

Specimens of sixteen to eighteen volutions slightly more than 6 mm. wide and 12.0 mm. long, giving form ratios of about 2.0. First two to three volutions inflated ellipsoidal to subspherical in shape, with very bluntly pointed poles. Beyond fourth volution shell assumes its mature shape. Lateral slopes of all parts of shell distinctly convex. However, as maturity is approached, lateral slopes become almost straight in end zones. Form ratios of first to sixteenth volution are 1.0, 1.0, 1.1, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.8, 1.8, 1.8, 1.8, 1.8, 1.8, 1.8, 1.8, 1.9, and 2.0, respectively.\\nProloculus spherical in shape, minute in size, with an outside diameter of 77 to 108 microns. Shell expands slowly and uniformly for first nine volutions and expands even more slowly from there to maturity. Heights of chambers in first to sixteenth volution are 38, 54, 78, 78, 108, 148, 164, 198, 238, 229, 253, 306, 330, 325, 330, and 327, respectively.\\nSpirotheca thick, distinctly alveolar. Alveoli very narrow. All alveoli apparently extend from base of keriotheca or from lower surfaces of septula completely to tops of spirotheca. The true thickness of the spirotheca is difficult to measure because both transverse and axial septula intersect the thin sections at numerous places. Thicknesses of spirotheca at its thinnest point between adjacent septula in first to sixteenth volution are about 14, 17, 21, 24, 33, 37, 26, 40, 35, 40, 57, 70, 87, 87, 87, and 82 microns, respectively.\\nAxial septula present in most if not all parts of shell. Axial septula are difficult to recognize in the first two volutions. Some chambers in third volution have two distinct axial septula, other chambers there have only one. Chambers in outer volutions of mature specimens have one or two axial septula. A rudimentary suggestion of a third axial septulum is present in the outermost volutions of larger specimens. Axial septula vary considerably in length and shape among different chambers throughout shell. They are formed by pendant ridges of spirotheca that more or less parallel septa, and contain distinct alveoli completely to their bases. Although axial septula are nearly straight throughout shell, some are slightly offset as they cross transverse septula.\\nThin axial fillings seemingly occur in extreme polar regions. However, the congestion of chambers in this region may result in crowding of parachomata to give the appearance of axial fillings."}

Un autre individu, plus \u00e9troit, n'atteint que 5.5 mm. de largeur au 23e tour, mais sa longueur d\u00e9passe 14 mm. Un troisi\u00e8me individu mesurait 10.3 mm. de longueur au 17e tour.

Dans les interstices, entre 2 de ces cloisons secondaires, la muraille de Neoschwagerina elongata est tr\u00e8s mince.

Les ouvertures buccales, perc\u00e9es dans la cloison principale, et qui ne sont en quelque sorte que les hublots de ces logettes, sont petites, mesurant 0.023 mm. au 10e tour, c'est-\u00e0-dire juste le tiers de la largeur d'une telle logette.\\nNeoschwagerina elongata rappelle par son endosquelette mince les N\u00e9oschwagerines du type globosa.

Larger shells contain four to five volutions and have an average form ratio of 2.4. A typical specimen of five volutions measures 3.5 mm. long and 1.6 mm. wide, giving a form ratio of 2.2. The form ratios of the first to the fifth volution are 1.3\uff0c1.7\uff0c2.0\uff0c2.2\uff0c and 2.0\uff0c respectively. The shape of the shell of any given volution varies widely.\\nThe proloculus is abnormally large for the size of the shell, and it is highly irregular in shape. In some specimens it is spherical in shape, but in most specimens it is deeply depressed around the proloculus pore and very broadly convex on the opposite side. Its greatest diameter varies from 219 to 353 microns. In general, the chambers are lowest immediately above the tunnel, but many of them are variable in height from pole to pole.

Upper and lower tectoria seem discontinuous in various parts of the shell. The thicknesses of the tectum and diaphanotheca in the third and fourth volutions measure about 24 and 27 microns, respectively. The proloculus wall measures about 15 microns.

The first volution is subspherical; the second to the last volution subcylindrical. A single microspheric specimen measures 3.690 mm. long and 1.476 mm. wide; the form ratio being 2.5. This specimen has a minute proloculus and 9 volutions, and the first two volutions are coiled at a large angle to the outer volutions.  \nThe proloculus is medium in size and spherical in shape. Its outside diameter is 114 to 197 microns. The thickness of the wall of the proloculus is 12 to 16 microns. The inner two to three volutions are tightly coiled, the following four to five volutions loosely. The height of the first to the seventh volution of the holotype is 33, 49, 66, 114, 148, 197, and 213 microns, respectively.  \nThe spirotheca is thin, composed of an indistinct tectum, a relatively thick diaphanotheca, and poorly developed upper and lower tectoria. The protheca is thicker than the epitheca. The diaphanotheca is clearly visible from the first to the last volution, but is often invisible in the first volution. The upper and the lower tectoria are thin and sometimes discontinuous; the former is thinner than the latter. The upper tectorium is hardly recognizable in all parts of the first to the last volution except the basal part of the septa, and the lower tectorium is recognizable in the outer volutions, but is discontinuous. The spirotheca of the outer volutions has rarely poorly developed fibrous or porous structure in some specimens. The thicknesses of the spirotheca, including protheca and epitheca, on the base of the tunnel of the first to the seventh volution of the holotype are 8, 12, 16, 20, 33, 41, and 33 microns, respectively. The thicknesses of the diaphanotheca of the second to the seventh volution of the holotype are ?, 8, 12, ?, 20, 20, and 24 microns, respectively.  \nThe septa are thin. They are composed of the downward deflection of the tectum, the diaphanotheca of the spirotheca of the preceding chamber, and the anterior clear layer, which corresponds to the continuation of the diaphanotheca of the spirotheca of the following chamber and does not extend downward to the base of the septa. The posterior and anterior sides of the septa are hardly covered by the lower tectorium.  \nThe septa are closely spaced, with high and narrowly irregular fluting throughout the length of the shell. The fluting in thin section makes a series of inverted U arranged on the surface of the preceding volution. The flutings extend nearly or entirely to the top of the chambers of the shell. The bases of the adjacent part of the fluted septa are in contact with each other on the surface of the preceding volution owing to the intense fluting. Chamberlets are often filled by dense calcite.  \nThe tunnel gradually increases in width through growth, being indistinct at the last volution. Its path is irregular; its top fluted.  \nThe narrow and irregular chomata are wart-like in the inner volutions and finger-like in the outer volutions and are very poorly developed throughout the shell or even absent partly. The chomata are one-half or more than one-half as high as the chambers.  \nDark-colored axial fillings commonly fill the chamber in the extreme polar regions of the second to the fourth volution."}

Nature specimens of 7 volutions are 3.70 to 4.0 mm. in length and about 1.3 mm. in width. The rate of increase in size is rather uniform throughout the length of the shell but there is a uniform decrease of form ratio in the third volution the form ratio is1:1.9, in the fourth volution 1:2.2, in the fifth volution 1:2.4, in the sixth volution 1:2.6, and in mature specimens 1:2.8.\\n\nThe septa are relatively thin and are composed of four layers. The two outer layers are thicker in the lower part of the septa where they fuse adjacent septa for about two-thirds the height of the chambers at the points of approach caused by the fluting. The posterior portion of the anterior tectorium is somewhat lighter than the remaining portion but it does not seem to join structurally with the diaphanotheca of the following Chamber. The external furrows have an irregular course across the mid-portion of the shell but they are somewhat sinuous in the region of the poles. The septa are very highly fluted throughout the length of the shell and the fluting extends to the top of the septa; however, it is less pronounced in the upper one-third of the chamber. Tangential sections show the flutings to form short elliptical openings or chamberlets; these are located in the lower portion of the chambers and they are about two-thirds as high as the chambers.\\n\nThe proloculum is sub-spherical to spherical and has a diameter of 80 to 100 microns. The ontogenetic development of individuals is divisible into an early state (a \"juvenarium\") during which the inner two and one-half volutions are tightly coiled and a later stage during which the outer volutions are less tightly coiled.\\n\nThe spirotheca or wall is relatively thick. The upper tectorium is about 6.0 microns thick in the sixth volution and is composed of rather dense material which is slightly less dense near its lower surface. The diaphanotheca measures 5.9 microns in the sixth volution. The lower tectorium is about 11.7 microns thick over the tunnel in the sixth volution but it thins rapidly toward the poles and is absent in the last volution. The upper tectorium is present on the floors of all chambers but it is not found on the spirotheca of the last volution. The difference in density between the diaphanotheca and the lower part of the upper tectorium is very slight and the line of division would be very difficult to locate if it were not for the presence of the tectum.\\n\nThe tunnel is rather low and broad and it is about one-third as high as the chamber and about one-fourth as high as wide. The average tunnel angle is about 22 degrees. The floor of the tunnel is covered by a thick layer of tectorium, and either side of the tunnel is bordered by a very high and broadly round, more or less symmetrical ridge, the choma, which, in the fifth and sixth volutions, is about two-thirds as high as the chambers and is about as broad at the top as it is high - it is only slightly developed in the outer volution. \n}"}
