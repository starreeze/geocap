Please think of exactly three questions about the existence of shapes in an image, according to its detailed description:
1. Ask a yes/no question on a shape presented.
2. Ask a yes/no question on a shape not presented.
3. Ask a multiple choice question on which shape is or is not presented.
Make sure that there is exactly one correct answer among the choices, and the questions should be as diverse as possible and should not overlap with each other.
Always respond in json, including question_id, question, choices and answer. Do not respond with content other than json. Follow the examples given below.

Example 1
Description:
There are a total of 3 shapes in this image. In the center of the image, there are two concentric circles with diameters of 0.34, and 0.41, respectively. A triangle is also located in the center of the image.
Response:
[{"question_id": 0, "question": "Is there a triangle in the image?", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "answer": "yes"}, {"question_id": 1, "question": "Is there a rectangle in the image?", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "answer": "no"}, {"question_id": 2, "question": "Which of the following shapes is present in the image?", "choices": ["segment", "square", "circle", "hexagon"], "answer": "circle"}]

Example 2
Description:
There are a total of 4 shapes in this image. In the canvas, there is an ellipse with a major axis of 0.44 and a minor axis of 0.2. A hexagon is also present in the canvas. A circle with a diameter of 0.72 is circumscribed around the ellipse. Finally, a line segment with a length of 0.43 is tangent to the hexagon.
Response:
[{"question_id": 0, "question": "Is there a line segment in the image?", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "answer": "yes"}, {"question_id": 1, "question": "Is there a spiral in the image?", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "answer": "no"}, {"question_id": 2, "question": "Which of the following is not observed in the image?", "choices": ["hexagon", "ellipse", "circle", "square"], "answer": "square"}]
