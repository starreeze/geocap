# Task:
You are provided with a description of a fossil image. You need to categorize and rearrange the description into different features.

# Requirements:
1. All possible features are as follows:
- shell
- length
- width
- ratio
- number of volutions
- heights of volutions
- proloculus
- axis
- axial filling
- spirotheca
- septa
- chomata
- tunnel shape
- tunnel angle
2. Group together the descriptions of the same feature
3. Wrap the descriptions of a specific feature with <feature> and </feature> tags
4. If a sentence does not contain any feature above, wrap the sentence with <others> and </others> tags
5. Note that 'secondary deposits' is not belong to axial filling and should be wrapped with <others> tags

# Examples:
## Description:
Shell large, elongate fusiform, with strongly curved axis of coiling and bluntly pointed poles; mature specimens have about 4.5 volutions, and measure 12.067 mm. in length and 3.828 mm. in diameter; first few whorls tightly coiled with sharply pointed poles, after which coiling becomes looser; height of volutions in the first to fifth volutions averages 288, 277, 492, 316 microns; form ratio 3.152.  \nSpirotheca thin in early volutions, and thickening rather abruptly at later ones; thickness of spirotheca of the first to fifth volutions averages 39, 37, 37, 56, 64 microns. Septa nearly plane in tightly coiled early volutions, becoming strongly fluted in more loosely coiled ones; septa folds high, commonly reaching tops of chambers.  \nProloculus moderate in size, its outside diameter 140 \u03bc. Tunnel moderately wide. Low, narrow chomata present except in outermost whorls.

## Description:
A moderately thick fusiform species with 8 volutions, reaching 7.579 mm in length and 2.640 mm in diameter, yielding a length-to-thickness ratio of 2.871 at maturity. Ends are somewhat bluntly rounded, with a gently convex yet uninflated mid-section.  \n\nProloculum moderately sized, typically 140 microns in diameter.  \n\nSpiral and septal walls thin. Axial filling negligible. \n\nSepta exhibit intense, regular folding, with opposing fold tips meeting as in *Schwagerina* s.s. Consequently, septal loops are tightly packed in all axial sections, occasionally with one loop series superimposed on another. This latter feature occurs only where septa incline sharply forward, and backward-directed folds of one septum rest on opposed folds of the preceding septum, resulting in a vertical slice intersecting both fold sets.  \n\nAverage volution heights (1st to 8th): 107, 137, 168, 166, 212, 271, 315 microns. Average thicknesses (1st to 8th): 14, 26, 29, 27, 26, 49, 18, 6 microns. Tunnel initiates with moderate angular widths: 52\u00b0 (1st volution), 66\u00b0 (2nd), 48\u00b0 (3rd), 53\u00b0 (4th), 33\u00b0 (5th), 22\u00b0 (6th), 34\u00b0 (7th).  \n\nChomata discernible in first 4\u20135 volutions, appearing as ridge-like deposits flanking the tunnel and as septal thickenings near the tunnel. Typically nearly obsolete in outer whorls, smaller than in other *Fusulina* species within our faunas. However, typical fusulinellid chomata present in the first volution and occasionally in the second.

## Description:
Shell small, subcylindrical, with moderately acute poles. Mature specimens exhibiting 4.0 volutions, initial coils more tightly wound than subsequent ones. Dimensions measuring 4.422 mm in length and 1.694 mm in diameter. Form ratio 2.610. Spirotheca thickness averaging 16, 16, 23, 16 microns across first to fourth volutions. Septa weakly fluted in inner whorls, becoming prominently folded in outer whorls. Volution heights averaging 124, 198, 237 microns in first to fourth whorls. Substantial secondary deposits nearly occupying axial chamber zones.  \n\nProloculus minute, external diameter 140 microns. Tunnel shallow and relatively constricted; tunnel angles measuring 39\u00b0, 53\u00b0, and 49\u00b0 in first, second, and third volutions respectively. Narrow chomata restricted to initial whorls.
