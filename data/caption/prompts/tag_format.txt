# Task:
You are provided with a description of a fossil image. You need to categorize and rearrange the description into different features.

# Requirements:
1. All possible features are as follows:
- shell
- length
- width
- ratio
- volution
- proloculus
- axis
- axial filling
- spirotheca
- septa
- chomata
- tunnel shape
- tunnel angle
2. Group together the descriptions of the same feature
3. Wrap the descriptions of a specific feature with <feature> and </feature> tags
4. If a sentence does not contain any feature above, wrap the sentence with <others> and </others> tags

# Examples:
## Description:
Shell large, elongate fusiform, with strongly curved axis of coiling and bluntly pointed poles; mature specimens have about 4.5 volutions, and measure 12.067 mm. in length and 3.828 mm. in diameter; first few whorls tightly coiled with sharply pointed poles, after which coiling becomes looser; height of volutions in the first to fifth volutions averages 288, 277, 492, 316 microns; form ratio 3.152.  \nSpirotheca thin in early volutions, and thickening rather abruptly at later ones; thickness of spirotheca of the first to fifth volutions averages 39, 37, 37, 56, 64 microns. Septa nearly plane in tightly coiled early volutions, becoming strongly fluted in more loosely coiled ones; septa folds high, commonly reaching tops of chambers.  \nProloculus moderate in size, its outside diameter 140 \u03bc. Tunnel moderately wide. Low, narrow chomata present except in outermost whorls.

## Description:
A moderately thick fusiform species with 8 volutions, reaching 7.579 mm in length and 2.640 mm in diameter, yielding a length-to-thickness ratio of 2.871 at maturity. Ends are somewhat bluntly rounded, with a gently convex yet uninflated mid-section.  \n\nProloculum moderately sized, typically 140 microns in diameter.  \n\nSpiral and septal walls thin. Axial filling negligible. \n\nSepta exhibit intense, regular folding, with opposing fold tips meeting as in *Schwagerina* s.s. Consequently, septal loops are tightly packed in all axial sections, occasionally with one loop series superimposed on another. This latter feature occurs only where septa incline sharply forward, and backward-directed folds of one septum rest on opposed folds of the preceding septum, resulting in a vertical slice intersecting both fold sets.  \n\nAverage volution heights (1st to 8th): 107, 137, 168, 166, 212, 271, 315 microns. Average thicknesses (1st to 8th): 14, 26, 29, 27, 26, 49, 18, 6 microns. Tunnel initiates with moderate angular widths: 52\u00b0 (1st volution), 66\u00b0 (2nd), 48\u00b0 (3rd), 53\u00b0 (4th), 33\u00b0 (5th), 22\u00b0 (6th), 34\u00b0 (7th).  \n\nChomata discernible in first 4\u20135 volutions, appearing as ridge-like deposits flanking the tunnel and as septal thickenings near the tunnel. Typically nearly obsolete in outer whorls, smaller than in other *Fusulina* species within our faunas. However, typical fusulinellid chomata present in the first volution and occasionally in the second.

## Description:
Test oval, subcylindrical mid-section with gradual tapering toward axial ends, L:D ratio 1.925. Initial two volutions nearly spherical; third volution onward rapidly assumes adult morphology, maintained through subsequent whorls.  \nMeasurements: L=4.488 mm; D=2.332 mm. Whorl count: 4.5. Proloculus large, spherical; diameter 228\u03bc. Proloculus wall thin.  \nSpire with consistent whorl height showing minimal increase beyond third/fourth volution. Mean whorl heights for first five volutions: 174, 224, 202, 189 microns. Fourth volution diameter typically 1.5-1.9 mm; rare specimens exhibit tighter spires (1.3 mm diameter in fourth volution) or broader spires (up to 2.40 mm diameter).  \nWall relatively thin, showing negligible thickening in outer three whorls; mean wall thickness for first five volutions: 44, 61, 60, 16, 58 microns. Septa moderately thick, approximating wall thickness, exhibiting irregular, intense folding across ~2/3 height. Tunnel angles: ~64\u00b0 (1st volution), 58\u00b0 (2nd), 24\u00b0 (3rd), 6\u00b0 (4th), 20\u00b0 (5th). Chomata absent. Axial deposits present as broad rounded patches occupying axial region from second to penultimate volution.
