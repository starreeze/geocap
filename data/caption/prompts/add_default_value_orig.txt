# Task:
You are provided with a description of a fossil image. Your task is to add default feature descriptions for any missing features according to the specifications below.

# Requirements
1. Add the following default feature descriptions ONLY if they are missing from the input:
   - axis: "Coiling axis straight to slightly curved"
   - septa: "Septa slightly fluted only at poles"
   - tunnel shape: "Tunnel of moderate height, moderate width"
   - chomata: "Chomata indistinct"
   - axial filling: "Axial filling present"

2. Insert missing features at appropriate locations in the description:
   - Place "axis" near shell description if missing
   - Add other missing features near the end of the description or near related features
   - Maintain the original flow and structure of the text

3. If all required features are already present in the input description (even with different content), return the input description unchanged, and do not add any additional explanation.

# Examples:
## Input description:
Test large, rhomboidal in shape, with one side concave and the other convex; median axis undulating, terminating in sharp extremities. Volutions numbering 6.0; initial volutions tightly coiled, becoming progressively looser outward. Volution heights for first to sixth whorls averaging 225, 179, 213, 317, 259 microns. Holotype dimensions 10.802 mm in length, 3.179 mm in width, axial ratio approximately 3.398:1. Spirotheca extremely thin in tightly coiled inner whorls; thickness measurements for first to sixth volutions averaging 25, 51, 43, 42, 45, 46 microns. Septa planar and straight in inner whorls, becoming fully fluted externally; flutings broadly rounded, occasionally extending to chamber tops. Chomata minute, observable only in inner volutions. Tunnels shallow, moderately broad; tunnel angles measuring approximately 39\u00b0 (1st), 32\u00b0 (2nd), 70\u00b0 (3rd), 56\u00b0 (4th), 62\u00b0 (5th), 28\u00b0 (6th). Axial fillings dense, present along lateral sides of median axis except in final volution. Proloculus circular, external diameter 228 microns.

## Input description:
Shell diminutive, central section cylindrical with conical, acutely pointed extremities. Adult specimens exhibit 1.0 whorls; initial coils tightly wound and slender cylindrical; subsequent whorls more loosely arranged with equatorial expansion. Dimensions measure 6.468 mm length and 2.464 mm diameter. Form ratio 2.625. Spirotheca thickness in initial whorl 21 \u03bc. Septa nearly planar in tightly coiled inner whorls, becoming prominently fluted in outer whorls. Substantial secondary deposits occupying most extra-equatorial shell volume. Proloculus extremely small (external diameter 246 \u03bc). Tunnel low-profile and constricted. Thin chomata present in early whorls but lacking in later stages.

## Input description:
Shell of moderate dimensions, exhibiting variable external morphology ranging from spherical to fusiform, with predominantly inflated fusiform specimens. Coiling axis nearly straight, lateral slopes consistently convex across all volutions. Mature specimens comprising 9 volutions; Chamber heights in successive volutions (1st to 9th) averaging 82, 98, 83, 89, 104, 424, 114, and 110 microns. measuring approximately 2.589 mm in width and 4.547 mm in length, yielding a form ratio of ~1.756. Proloculus moderately sized, irregularly spherical, with external diameter of 0.187 mm. Spirotheca comparatively thick, ~17 microns in outer shell regions. Thickness progression across volutions (1st to 9th) averaging 25, 13, 13, 16, 18, 9, 16, 19, and 30 microns, showing significant variation from initial to mature volutions. Tunnel angles measure ~48\u00b0 (1st), 69\u00b0 (2nd), 29\u00b0 (3rd), 31\u00b0 (4th), 5\u00b0 (5th), 26\u00b0 (7th), and 20\u00b0 (8th volution).
