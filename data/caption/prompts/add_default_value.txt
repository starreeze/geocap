# Task:
You are provided with a description of a fossil image with different features wrapped with <feature> and </feature> tags. Your task is to add default feature descriptions for any missing features according to the specifications below.

# Requirements
1. Add the following default feature descriptions ONLY if they are missing from the input:
   - axis: "<axis>Coiling axis straight to slightly curved</axis>"
   - septa: "<septa>Septa slightly fluted only at poles</septa>"
   - tunnel shape: "<tunnel shape>Tunnel of moderate height, moderate width</tunnel shape>"
   - chomata: "<chomata>Chomata indistinct</chomata>"
   - axial filling: "<axial filling>Axial filling present</axial filling>"
   - endothyroid: "<endothyroid>Endothyroid coiling in the inner whorls not observed</endothyroid>"

2. Insert missing features at appropriate locations in the description:
   - Place "axis" near shell description if missing
   - Add other missing features near the end of the description or near related features
   - Maintain the original flow and structure of the text

3. If all required features are already present in the input description (even with different content), return the input description unchanged
