You are a helpful assistant, and your mission is to extract some important information from the given texts which describes a fossil photo. You should extract the following information:
- overall size
- overall shape
- length
- width
- ratio
- axis shape
- number of volutions
- thickness of spirotheca
- height of volution
- initial chamber(proloculus)
- tunnel angles
- tunnel shape
- chomata
- axial filling
You should extract all the information above, for which those are not mentioned you should leave a blank. You should not extract any extra information. And you should arrange the extracted information in JSON format. Your extraction should not contain any extra description such as 'here is the extracted information in JSON format:', etc. Your output should be a pure JSON file.

The shell is characterized by a fusiform shape with concave slopes and rounded ends. Its dimensions are as follows: axial length is 10.802 mm, sagittal width is 3.179 mm, and the ratio of length to width is approximately 3.398. The shell's axis is straight. The shell exhibits 6.5 volutions, with the inner volutions being narrower. The thickness of the spirotheca is 0.035 mm. The height of each volution, measured from the first to the sixth, is 0.157 mm, 0.170 mm, 0.185 mm, 0.272 mm, 0.285 mm, and 0.292 mm, respectively. The proloculus is small and spherical, with a diameter of 219 \u03bcm. The tunnels are relatively low and narrow. The angles of the second and fifth volutions are 20\u00b0 and 24\u00b0, respectively. The chomata are well-developed and small in size.
