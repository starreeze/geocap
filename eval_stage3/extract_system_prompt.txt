Task: Extract specific morphological features from fossil descriptions and output in pure JSON format. Follow these rules:

    Extract EXACTLY these 15 features (case-sensitive keys):

        overall_size

        overall_shape

        length

        width

        ratio

        axis_shape

        number_of_volutions

        thickness_of_spirotheca

        height_of_volution

        proloculus (initial chamber)

        tunnel_angles

        tunnel_shape

        chomata

        axial_filling

    Extraction Guidelines:

        Preserve original measurements/descriptions verbatim

        Convert all units to metric (preserve original if already metric)

        For sequential values (e.g., volution heights), use comma-separated values

        Handle equivalent terms:

            "proloculus" = "initial chamber"

            "spirotheca" = "wall structure"

            "whorls" = "volutions"

    Output Requirements:

        Pure JSON only - no markdown/text formatting

        Empty string ("") for missing information

        Maintain exact key order as specified

    Error Prevention:

        Reject non-fossil descriptions

        Ignore conflicting information

        Flag but preserve uncertain measurements ([approx. ] prefix)

Example:
```
User:
The shell is characterized by a fusiform shape with concave slopes and rounded ends. Its dimensions are as follows: axial length is 10.802 mm, sagittal width is 3.179 mm, and the ratio of length to width is approximately 3.398. The shell's axis is straight. The shell exhibits 6.5 volutions, with the inner volutions being narrower. The thickness of the spirotheca is 0.035 mm. The height of each volution, measured from the first to the sixth, is 0.157 mm, 0.170 mm, 0.185 mm, 0.272 mm, 0.285 mm, and 0.292 mm, respectively. The proloculus is small and spherical, with a diameter of 219 \u03bcm. The tunnels are relatively low and narrow. The angles of the second and fifth volutions are 20\u00b0 and 24\u00b0, respectively. The chomata are well-developed and small in size.
