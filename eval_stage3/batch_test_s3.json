Septa closely spaced in inner volutions, widely spaced in fourth and fifth volutions, and somewhat more closely spaced in outer volutions. Septa fluted throughout the length of the shell, but fluting seems to be irregularly developed, probably due largely to irregular attitude of septa. In general, septa tend to curve anteriorly. Most of them are irregular in vertical sections. Many septa are strongly sinuous in vertical sections, fluting forms closed chamberlets in the lower half to fourth of chambers, tangential sections reveal transverse paths connecting adjacent chambers, as are found in Parafusulina. Cuneoli have not been previously reported in pseudoschwagerina. It should, however, be stressed that published tangential sections of Pseudoschwagerina are indeed rare, and the presence or absence of cuneoli in most previously described forms of the genus cannot be verified from available information. A restudy of the original or topotype material of previously described forms may demonstrate that cuneoli are common rather than rare in pseudoschwagerina. The presence of cuneoli in p. dallmusi may indicate that this form is highly advanced. Septal pores exceedingly abundant throughout the shell but most easily observed in outer volutions. Septal counts of first to sixth volutions of one specimen 13, 18, 21, 22, 27, and 30, respectively.\"Tunnel very low and moderately wide.

Average form ratios of the first to seventh volution in six specimens are 1.6, 1.9, 2.3, 2.6, 2.6, 2.4, and 2.1, respectively.The proloculus is minute, with an outside diameter of 66 microns. The shell expands slowly during the first four volutions, but beyond this the chambers increase in height rapidly. Average height of chambers in the first to seventh volution in six specimens is 50, 75, 120, 180, 320, 411, and 444 microns, respectively. The height of a given chamber is about the same from the tunnel to the poles.The spirotheca is thin in the first volution, measuring 10 to 17 microns. However, it increases in thickness gradually, being 78 to 102 microns in the sixth volution. The average thickness of the spirotheca in the first to seventh volution in six specimens is 15, 26, 42, 66, 76, 87, and 85 microns, respectively. Although the spirotheca contains coarse alveoli, its detailed structure cannot be determined in many of my specimens.The septa are thin and contain abundant septal pores. They are closely spaced in the inner three or four volutions but more widely spaced in outer ones. However, the length of chambers in outer volutions is not so great in comparison to shell size as that of most forms referred to this genus. Septal fluting is well defined in the polar areas and extends to the tops of chambers of outermost volutions. However, in tunnel areas, the fluting is confined mainly to the lower parts of chambers. The septal counts of the first to fifth volution of the illustrated sagittal section (fig. 17) are 13, 19, 23, 28, and 26, respectively.The tunnel is narrow in the inner four volutions, increasing in width rapidly beyond the fifth volution. Average tunnel angles in the first to seventh volution of four specimens are 16, 19, 22, 12, 34, 50, and 42 degrees, respectively. The chomata are broad and high in the inner four volutions, and they are narrow and low in the fifth, sixth, and seventh volutions."}, {"img": "/home/nfs03/xingsy/MimicBrush/pics/Pseudoschwagerina_orientale_1_2.png", "question": "The following is an image of a paleontological fossil, please provide a detailed description for the fossil image.

The lateral slopes taper regularly to rather sharp poles. The proloculum is commonly large but shows a wide range of variation as in P. uddeni with extremes of 176 and 400 microns. The juvenarium consists of 2\u00bd to 4 volutions coiled rather closely as in Triticites, the number tending to vary inversely with the size of the proloculum. Following the juvenarium, there is a great increase in the height of the whorls, but the change is not quite so abrupt or so extreme as in P. uddeni. The last volution declines somewhat in height. The antetheca increases in height from the middle to the ends, and the ratio of length to diameter as well as the axial profile change only slightly during growth, the ratio being commonly between 2.5 and 3.0 to 1 at maturity. In shells of few rapidly expanding volutions, the measurements vary greatly depending upon the accidental orientation of the axial section with respect to the beginning of the point of inflation, and the measurements and calculated form ratios both show an irregularity that is more apparent than real.The wall is somewhat thicker than in P. uddeni, measuring 0.074 mm in the outer whorls. The septa are rather strongly fluted near their basal margin, but as a result of their wide spacing, opposed folds commonly do not meet. In axial sections, septal loops are abundant or sparse depending on the position of the slice in the chambers. Septalare is abundant in all the inflated whorls.This species displays considerable variation in its proportions and in the distinctness with which its juvenarium is set off by the inflation of the post-nepionic whorls. On the one hand, there are shells relatively shorter and thicker than the types, which grade toward P. uddeni, and on the other hand, there are some that are not easily separated from Schwagerina huecoensis. One of the latter type is here separated as a distinct variety, ultima. Apparent differences in proportions are commonly the result of rounding or breaking of the ends as the shells weather free. The inflation takes place within less than half a volution in the average individual but there are occasional shells in which the expansion is more gradual and the generic character is not well marked. It might be supposed that Pseudoschwagerina texana represents the first stage in divergence of this genus from Schwagerina and that actual intergradation at this horizon. On the contrary, it may be argued that this species, in returning to an elongate form, is reducing its inflation and developing a semblance to Schwagerina through convergence. Finally, it might be supposed that this species represents an evolution out of Schwagerina while P. uddeni and other highly inflated species with slightly fluted septa have developed out of it, in which case Pseudoschwagerina is polyphyletic. Of the three alternatives, the second appears most probable. This is not an early or a small species but one of the largest and latest in the Texas section. Its juvenarium has all the features of a primicites with well-developed chomata and a fairly thick wall. Moreover, its first inflated whorls is higher than the rest, suggesting a more inflated stage in its ancestry. The oldest and smallest species in the section, P. beedei, stands as a suitable ancestor from which P. uddeni and P. texana have diverged, one becoming progressively more inflated and the other reverting to a more elongate form.Tunnel low and rather narrow, tunnel angle measuring 12 degrees in the 1st volution, 5 degrees in the 2nd volution, 41 degrees in the 3rd volution, 34 degrees in the 4th volution, 39 degrees in the 5th volution, and 19 degrees in the 6th volution.

Dass ibrigens auch l\u00e4ngere Exemplare vorkommen, welche den Typus aber doch stets sehr wohl erkennen lassen, das ist Etwas, was bei allen \u00e4hnlichen Formen immer wiederkehrt. Die einzelnen Kammern sind deutlich und gerundet gew\u00f6lbt, durch tiefe, Scharf markirte Naths getrennt, verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4ssig nur wenig nach vorn gezogen. Die Schale zeigte durchschnittlich 4.0 Umg\u00e4nge und im vierten Umgang 28-30 Kammern. F\u00fcr die Schalendicke fand ich als mittlere Gr\u00f6ssen: -2-2,25,3,3.5,5,6. Hier f\u00e4llt wohl vor allem wieder die grosse Embryonale, welche in 7,9. dieser Hinsicht verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4ssig nur geringe Schwankungen zeigt, so wie das rasche Anwachsen der Kammern auf, das noch st\u00e4rker hervortritt, wenn man die H\u00f6hen ihrer Lumina allein untereinander vergleicht. Die Septa sind verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4ssig d\u00fcnn, gleichm\u00e4ssig aber fein gefaltet, und zeigen in Durchschnitten, namentlich gegen die Enden zu, ziemlich regelm\u00e4ssige und gedr\u00e4ngte Verbindungen.

Die Schalenporen sind verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4ssig ziemlich stark und erreichen nicht selten eine Dicke von bis 0.1 mm, dieselben werden im Allgemeinen durch ann\u00e4hernd gleichgrosse Zwischenr\u00e4ume getrennt. Wenn man nur das Aller\u00e4usserste der Gestalt in Betracht ziehen wollte, so k\u00f6nnte man allerdings dazu bewogen werden, unsere Form mit einer ganzen Reihe \u00e4hnlicher, besonders amerikanischer Vorkommnisse zusammenzuwerfen: bei einem genaueren Vergleich findet man aber doch zu erhebliche und namentlich zu konstante Unterschiede, als dass dies so ohne Weiteres gerechtfertigt sein k\u00f6nne. Fusulina ventricosa Meek et Haven aus dem Kohlenkalk von Illinois ist es aber, welche hier vor Allem in Betracht zu ziehen w\u00e4re, und hatte ich gl\u00fccklicherweise Gelegenheit, dieselbe in Exemplaren, welche vom Originalfundort stammen, zu untersuchen. So sehr vie Allgemeingestalt bei manchen Exemplaren beider Formen f\u00fcr den ersten Augenblick \u00fcbereinzustimmen scheint, weil deren kurzer gedrungener Bau vor Allem auff\u00e4llt, so findet man schon in dieser Hinsicht den konstanten Unterschied, dass unsere Form wohl niemals so hervortretende seitliche Schalenspitzen besitzt, wie sie bei der amerikanischen Art normal zu sein scheinen, sondern dass bei ihr die Verschmalerung zu den ebenfalls abgestumpten seitlichen Enden weit gleichm\u00e4ssiger geschieht. Weit auff\u00e4lliger wird jedoch der Unterschied, wenn wir uns nicht bloss auf den \u00e4usseren Anblick verlassen, sondern auch die inneren Verh\u00e4ltnisse beider genau vergleichen.

As in Schellwienia uul\u011faris, the present species is also characterized by its remarkably thick spirotheca, relatively thin antethecae and very coarsely alveolar osseum. There is no question as to its intimate relation with Schellwienia uul\u011faris. For this reason, it seems not unjustifiable to regard it as a variety of that species. After a careful comparison with the typical uul\u011faris, I find however that there are between them some differentiating features that are at least more marked than those between Schellwtenia uul\u011fariss str. and its other related species, for instance, Schellwienia krotowi. If the latter is to be placed in the rank of a species as Schellwien has done, it appears fair treatment to regard the form under discussion as an independent species as well.Test of this species regularly fusiform up to the fifth volution, then it tends to assume acylindrical shape with its umbilical ends more or less rounded. Axis of the whorls is, as a rule, rectilinear, but occasionally recurved in the median region. Axial length varies from 6 to 7.4 mm and the median width from 1.9 to 2.5 mm, with an average axial ratio of 1:3. Darwas form seems somewhat larger than our representative, though the axial ratio is practically the same.These measurements show that the rate of spiral expansion is much lower than in Schellwienia uul\u011faris; in other words, the whorls are more compactly coiled. Spirotheca is also slightly thinner than in Schell. uul\u011faris.Osseum coarsely alveolar, but not quite so coarse as in Schellwienia uul\u011faris. Antethecae fairly thin, intensely and regularly folded.Buccal aperture broad and comparatively narrow reaching about half the height of the chamber in the first three volutions, and about 2/5 of the height of the chamber from the fourth volution onward. Only a vestige of anuli is observed in the axial section as two small black spots attached to the wall of the initial chamber.Initial chamber spheroidal with an external diameter of 0.3 mm for the macrospheric type, and 0.11 mm for the microspheric.

The shape is fusiform with irregular to concave lateral slopes and bluntly pointed poles. The coiling is relatively loose and the chambers relatively open with little secondary filling and small chomata.The spiral form is normal to normal negative increasing regularly through the early volutions and increasing only slightly less in the outer volutions. The pattern for the increase in height of volution shows that the increase is quite regular throughout most of the growth, with the 1st volution being 0.086 mm, the 2nd volution 0.092 mm, the 3rd volution 0.108 mm, the 4th volution 0.142 mm, the 5th volution 0.116 mm, and the 6th volution 0.159 mm.The length increases logarithmically in relation to the diameter. The spread is narrow throughout, indicating a close homogeneity in specimens from the seven samples. The form ratio increases rapidly in the early stages of growth and then remains almost constant at 1.960. The shape is fusiform throughout, with a tendency to develop concave lateral slopes even in some of the early volutions.The proloculus ranges in outer diameter from 50 to 130 microns in the megalospheric specimens. More than a third of the specimens are in the 75 to 90 micron range, and the rest fall about equally to each side of this central cluster. Several microspheric juvenaria were found with proloculi about 25 microns in diameter. Some specimens with larger proloculi seem intermediate in form with the initial chambers at an angle to the adult chambers. The initial chamber (proloculus) measures 109 \u03bc.The wall thickness increases regularly. The maximum thickness recorded was 0.042 mm. All measurements were taken from the equatorial area and, although the wall appears to thin gradually toward the poles no measurements were taken in that area. The wall has a tectum and well-defined diaphanotheca and thin, irregular tectoria, mostly in the vicinity of the septa.The septa tend to be plane or slightly fluted and are spaced rather regularly throughout most of the shell. The septal spacing increases arithmetically with increasing radius. The septa are thickened to wedges or bulbs by secondary deposits in the vicinity of the tunnel and chomata.The tunnel is well defined by the chomata. It is generally low, extending less than half the height of the chambers. It tends to be straight or only slightly irregular and increases rapidly in width. The bounding chomata are small and tend to be symmetrical. Where the plane of the septa coincides or nearly coincides with the plane at the section, the chomata appear to be more massive and asymmetrical because of the extensions of secondary deposits along the septa.

Axis of coiling straight to slightly irregular. Mature forms of five volutions are about 3.597 mm in length and 1.111 mm in width. The form ratio of mature individuals is 3.238. The central portion of the shell is rather markedly inflated throughout growth and the lateral slopes are slightly concave. The septa are thin. They are composed of five layers. However, all of these layers can be clearly seen only near the center of the shell in the outer volutions. The anterior diaphanotheca decreases in thickness very rapidly toward the base of the septa and in the lower portion of the septa it cannot be recognized. In the end portions of the shell the different layers of the septa cannot be differentiated. The septal count gives 16 to 14 for the third volution, 14 to 20 for the fourth volution, 17 to 22 for the fifth volution, and 22 for the sixth volution. The septa are rather broadly but highly fluted in the polar regions and they are essentially unfluted near the center of the shell.The inside diameter of the proloculum is 54 microns.

Near the poles, the different layers of the spirotheca are very difficult to differentiate, but the tectoria seem to increase in thickness poleward and the diaphanotheca becomes exceedingly thin.The tunnel is very low and broad. In the second volution it is about one-sixth as high as broad and about one-third as high as the chambers. The tunnel angle measures 14 degrees in the second volution, 12 degrees in the third volution, and 6 degrees in the fourth volution.

The average form ratios of the first to seventh volution in six specimens are 1.2, 1.6, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, and 2.6, respectively.The proloculus is minute, and its outside diameter measures 44 microns. The shell expands uniformly. The average heights of the chambers above the tunnel in the first to the sixth volution of nine specimens are 31, 45, 60, 79, 108, and 134 microns, respectively. The chambers increase in height in the polar regions of the outer volutions.The spirotheca is thin, and it is composed of four layers. The diaphanotheca is relatively thick in the outer three volutions. It is not clearly visible, however, in the inner three volutions. The diaphanotheca seemingly is not developed in the outer one-half of the last volution, indicating that the diaphanotheca formed later than the tectum. The average thicknesses of the diaphanotheca in the fourth to the sixth volution of nine specimens are 7.3, 9.8, and 13.3 microns, respectively. The diaphanotheca thins toward the poles, but it is recognizable to the poles in the first half of the ultimate volutions of mature specimens.The septa are thin. The diaphanotheca of the spirotheca extends downward almost to the base of the septa on the posterior side of the tectum. However, it extends only a short distance down the septa on the anterior side of the tectum. The septa are almost normal to the spirotheca. The average septal counts of the first to the sixth volution in four specimens are 9, 12, 16, 20, 22, and 23, respectively. The septa are irregularly fluted in the extreme polar regions, and they are irregularly undulated almost to the edges of the tunnel in the outer three volutions of mature specimens.The tunnel is low and broad in the outer volutions. It is narrow in the inner volutions. The average tunnel angles in the first to sixth volution of five specimens are 5, 8, 16, 18, 18, and 9 degrees, respectively. Chomata are present in all parts of the shell except the last part of the outer volution. Their tunnel side is vertical to overhanging, and their poleward slope is low in the inner volution and steep in the outer two volutions. Chomata extend almost to the poles in the inner three to four volutions.

Kurz ellipsoidal, manchmal fast sph\u00e4risch, regelm\u00e4\u00dfig abgerundet mit runden oder ein wenig umbilicalen Polen. Das Geh\u00e4use ist 4.411 mm. lang, 3.542 mm. breit.

Das endothyroide Juvenarium ist seltener als das nautiloide. Die ersten zwei bis drei Windungen sind nautiloid, die Weiteren sind kugelig, dann ellipsoidal, sogar mehr verl\u00e4ngert als am Ende. Um den sechsten Umgang erreichen sie das maximale L/B-Verh\u00e4ltnis. Im zw\u00f6lften Umgange ist schon die Form der letzten Windung erreicht. Vierzehn bis achtzehnundeinhalb Umg\u00e4nge. Die Embrionalkammer ist sehr klein, sein innerer Durchmesser ist 0.024-0.058 mm. Die Septen sind etwas schr\u00e4g gestellt. Vom funften Umgange weiter reihen sich zwischen die Septen die axiale Septulen ein. Vom achten Umgange weiter substituieren sich je zwei und ganz am Ende kommen manchmal auch je drei Septulen vor.

Comparing graphically these figures with those obtained from the typical specimens of quasicylindrica it will be noticed that the first parts of the graphs practically coincide. But in the last parts the graph for the present variety shows a decidedly lower gradient than those for the typical quasicylindrica.Another point of demarcation is their relative length or axial ratios. In the typical quasicylindrica the axial length usually exceeds 9 mm with an axial ratio of 1:5 when its number of volutions reaches 6; whereas the present variety, though having 5.5 volutions, barely attains a length of 5.515 mm with an axial ratio of only about 1:3.760.The height of each volution is as follows: 0.120 mm for the 1st volution, 0.116 mm for the 2nd volution, 0.119 mm for the 3rd volution, 0.135 mm for the 4th volution, and 0.171 mm for the 5th volution.

The middle of the shell is broadly convex but not inflated and the lateral slopes are nearly flat or gently convex, tapering to subacute poles. The shape changes but little during growth, the form ratio being near 1.5 in the first volution and increasing to near 2.5 at maturity.The proloculum is moderately large, the average diameter being near 219 microns. The whorls expand gradually and moderately rapidly and the wall is thin, the protheca reaching a maximum thickness of 0.025 mm in the outer volutions and the epitheca being slightly thinner. The fine tubular mural pores are clearly visible locally in the outer whorls and are further emphasized by staining.The septa are strongly folded from pole to equator in all volutions, as clearly seen in a thick section like figure 15 of plate 14, or in tangential sections like figure 10.

The half length is accurately secured by dividing his measurements for the length, but by taking half of his measurements of the diameter in place of the radius vector we have introduced a slight systematic error, for in shells that expand as rapidly as these the radius vector is appreciably more than half a diameter.

In this species, the tunnel angle measures 5 degrees in the 2nd volution, 5 degrees in the 3rd volution, 9 degrees in the 4th volution, and 15 degrees in the 5th volution.These three forms occur together in the Brereton limestone and apparently are genetically related. In a locality such as station B9, where thousands of specimens can be freed from a calcareous shale, the majority can be separated on shape alone into three groups here recognized.

The septa are relatively thin and are composed of four layers. The two outer layers are thicker in the lower part of the septa where they fuse adjacent septa for about two-thirds the height of the chambers at the points of approach caused by the fluting. The posterior portion of the anterior tectorium is somewhat lighter than the remaining portion but it does not seem to join structurally with the diaphanotheca of the following chamber. The external furrows have an irregular course across the mid-portion of the shell but they are somewhat sinuous in the region of the poles. The septa are very highly fluted throughout the length of the shell and the fluting extends to the top of the septa; however, it is less pronounced in the upper one-third of the chamber.

The upper tectorium is about 6.0 \u03bcm thick in the sixth volution and is composed of rather dense material which is slightly less dense near its lower surface.

The prolocula are commonly 44 \u03bc in diameter and are subspherical. The shells are tightly coiled, the equatorial expansion being slow and gradual. The spiral wall is commonly not more than 0.020 mm thick, the inner tectorium being relatively thin and the outer tectorium thick. In specimen 1 of the table of measurements the wall is locally thicker due to an abnormal thickness of such epitheca.The septa are deeply fluted and in axial sections the septal loops are crowded even to the middle of the shell. Septal pores are abundant.The tunnel is of moderate width, the tunnel angle increasing generally from about 5 degrees in the third whorl to 30\u00b0-40\u00b0 in the fifth. Chomata are very narrow and, in axial sections, commonly are not easily distinguished from the associated septal loops."}]
