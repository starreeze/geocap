the method `clarify_hierarchical_choices` fix the ambiguity in choices. However, the questions also contain types, and it needs to be considered in generation time instead of post processing to ensure a smooth expression. Please implement the similar procedure for questions in each method if necessary.

You made a meaningful attempt, but there are some issues.
1. expression: ([...] excluded) is not a good choice because it is only suitable for counting, and you should tailor it to each question.
2. only add clarification when necessary, i.e., when the child types appear in the image.
