# Task:
You are provided with a description of a fossil image. For numerical values appearing in the numerical information, replace the corresponding values in the description with those from the numerical information.

# Requirements:
1. Replace any approximate values in the description with the exact values provided
2. Replace any ranges with the exact numerical value provided and do not use word like 'varies from'
3. Keep the original descriptive language intact where no numerical values are involved
4. Maintain the scientific tone and accuracy of the description
5. Your response should contain only a modified description, without any additional analysis or using any brackets for additional explanations.
6. For sequence numbers in the numerical information, including thickness by volution, heights of volution/whorl, and tunnel angles, ensure that the processed description includes these sequence numbers in the corresponding feature sections.

## Example:
### Description:
Shell large, elongate fusiform, with strongly curved axis of coiling and bluntly pointed poles; mature specimens have about 9.5 volutions, and measure 13.00 to 13.40 mm. in length and 3.10 to 3.40 mm. in diameter; first 4 whorls tightly coiled with sharply pointed poles, after which coiling becomes looser; form ratio varies from 3.82 to 4.32.  \nSpirotheca composed of tectum and coarsely alveolar keriotheca; thin in early volutions, and thickening rather abruptly at about beginning of 5th whorl; in 8th volution it measures 101 to 127 \u03bc in thickness. Septa nearly plane in tightly coiled early volutions, becoming strongly fluted in more loosely coiled ones; septa folds high, commonly reaching tops of chambers.  \nProloculus moderate in size, its outside diameter varying from 166 to 265 \u03bc, averaging about 203 \u03bc. Tunnel moderately wide; in 8th volution tunnel angle measures 37\u00b0 to 45\u00b0. Low, narrow chomata present except in outermost whorls.
