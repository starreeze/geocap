Here is some information about the fossil:\nlength: 10.802 mm. , width(diameter): 3.179 mm. ratio: 3.398\nnumber of volutions(whorls): 6.5\naverage thickness of spirotheca: 35 microns\nthickness by volutions: 21, 34, 40, 30, 52, 30, 40 microns\nheights of volution/whorl: 157, 170, 185, 272, 285, 292 microns\ninitial chamber(proloculus): 219 microns\ntunnel angles: 20 degrees in the 2nd volution, 24 degrees in the 5th volution.\nAssistant:Test large, rhomboid in outline, concave in middle on one side and convex on another side; median axis sinuous, and extremities sharp. Volutions 8-10; inner 4-5 volutions tightly involute and successive ones loosing gradually. Holotype specimen 10.87 mm long, 2.92 mm wide, and about 3.72:1 in axial ratio. Spirotheca very thin in tightly coiled inner volutions, about 0.008-0.01 mm thick; thickening outwards; composed of a tectum and a keriotheca; the spirotheca on the eighth volution about 0.07 mm thick. Septa are plane and straight in the inner volutions, and completely fluted in the outer volutions; flutings broadly rounded in general, sometimes reaching the top of the chambers in height. Chomata small, only visible in the inner volutions. Tunnels low, moderately wide. Axial fillings heavy, distributed on the lateral sides of median axis, except the final volution. Proloculus circular."  # Test: No Pre-info & With Pre-info
