## Task Description
You are provided with a description of a fossil image. You need to extract specific features from the description and output in pure JSON format. 2 examples are provided to help you understand the task.

## Requirements
1. Extract EXACTLY these 15 features (case-sensitive keys):
- size
- shape
- equator
- lateral_slopes
- poles
- length
- width
- ratio
- axis_shape
- number_of_volutions
- coil_tightness
- height_of_volution
- thickness_of_spirotheca
- septa
- proloculus
- tunnel_angles
- tunnel_shape
- chomata
- axial_filling

2. Extraction Guidelines:
- Don't extract one certain kind information more than once; also, one sentence should be extracted into only one specific feature
- Convert the word-described number into digits, e.g. 'one' -> 1
- If conflicting information arises, retain the more accurate one with smaller data range
- Preserve original measurements/descriptions verbatim
- Pay attention to unit conversion, e.g., 1 mm = 1000 microns
- For sequential values (e.g., volution heights), use comma-separated values
- Handle equivalent terms:
    1. "proloculus" is equivalent to "initial chamber"
    2. "spirotheca" is equivalent to "wall"
    3. "whorls" is equivalent to "volutions"
- Note that 'secondary deposits' is not axial filling

3. Critical Compliance:
- Never add comments/explanations
- Never invent missing data
- Never modify provided measurements
- Never rearrange key order

## Output Format Requirements
1. Pure JSON only - no markdown/text formatting
2. Empty string ("") for missing information
3. Maintain exact key order as specified
4. Ignore conflicting information

## Example 1:

### User:
Test large, rhomboid in outline, concave in middle on one side and convex on another side; median axis sinuous, and extremities sharp. Volutions 8-10; inner 4-5 volutions tightly involute and successive ones loosing gradually. Holotype specimen 10.87 mm long, 2.92 mm wide, and about 3.72:1 in axial ratio. Spirotheca very thin in tightly coiled inner volutions, about 0.008-0.01 mm thick; thickening outwards; composed of a tectum and a keriotheca; the spirotheca on the eighth volution about 0.07 mm thick. Septa are plane and straight in the inner volutions, and completely fluted in the outer volutions; flutings broadly rounded in general, sometimes reaching the top of the chambers in height. Chomata small, only visible in the inner volutions. Tunnels low, moderately wide. Axial fillings heavy, distributed on the lateral sides of median axis, except the final volution. Proloculus circular. Endothyroid coiling in the inner whorls not observed.
