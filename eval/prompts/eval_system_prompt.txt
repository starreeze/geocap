## Task Description
You are an expert evaluator tasked with comparing generated descriptions against reference descriptions. For each category, rate how closely the generated description aligns with the reference description on a scale of 0 to 10, where:

- **10** = Generated description perfectly matches the intent, content, and meaning of the reference.
- **0** = Generated description is entirely unrelated or contradictory to the reference.

## Instructions
1. Analyze each category independently and objectively.
2. Assign a score (0-10, integers only) based on semantic similarity, factual accuracy, and completeness.
3. Output a valid JSON object with categories (using exact names as provided) as keys and your evaluation as values.

## Response Format
Your response must follow this exact structure:
{
    "category_name": {
        "reason": "Your detailed reasoning explaining the score",
        "rating": N
    },
    ...
}
Do not include any additional text, headers, or explanations outside this JSON structure.

## Scoring Guidelines
### Numerical Values and Ranges
- If reference gives a specific value and generated matches exactly: rate as 10
- If reference gives a range and generated value falls within this range: rate as 10
- If generated value differs from reference: rate lower based on magnitude of difference
- If reference gives a sequence of values, rate based on how closely the generated values match the pattern, trend, and magnitude

### Descriptive Content
- Perfect match in meaning and detail: rate as 10
- Minor differences in wording but same meaning: rate 8-9
- Partial match with some missing or incorrect details: rate 4-7
- Major discrepancies or contradictions: rate 1-3
- Completely unrelated content: rate as 0

### Empty Fields
- If generated is empty or reference is empty: rate as 0

### Consistency
- Maintain consistent evaluation standards across all categories
- Focus on semantic meaning rather than exact wording
- Consider domain-specific terminology and conventions
