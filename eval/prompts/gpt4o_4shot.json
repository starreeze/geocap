        "output": "Assistant: The shell is Large, with extended, bluntly pointed to rounded poles, inflated center, and almost straight axis of coiling. It has sharply pointed poles in the inner three volutions, but from the fourth volution outward the poles become slightly extended and bluntly pointed to rounded. In the fourth and fifth volutions of some specimens the lateral slopes are slightly concave. Mature specimens contain six to seven volutions and are 9.4 to 10.6 mm. long and 4.3 to 5.0 mm. wide. The average form ratio of three mature specimens is 2.1. The form ratio increases about uniformly for the first three to four volutions but increases only slightly, if at all, in the outer three volutions.\n\"The proloculus is large, with outside diameter of 380 to 440 microns. The expansion of the shell is about uniform during the first three volutions; during the fourth volution the height of the chambers increases rapidly, and from there to maturity the chambers decrease in height slowly. The outermost volution of mature specimens is relatively tightly coiled. The height of the first to seventh volution averages 116, 188, 244, 404, 564, 533, and 480 microns, respectively.\n\"The spirotheca is relatively thick for the genus. The thickness of the spirotheca in the first to seventh volution averages 27, 38, 54, 75, 97, 105, and 103 microns, respectively. The spirotheca increases in thickness slowly with growth of the individual for the first four volutions, beyond which it increases in thickness rapidly but decreases in the outermost volution of mature specimens.\n\"The septa are closely spaced in the inner four to five volutions, more widely spaced in the following two volutions. They are narrowly and highly fluted throughout the length of the shell. The folds of the septa are not uniform vertically, however, for axial sections may intersect the same fold at two points. The septa are thick in the area of the tunnel and are thin in the polar region.\n\"The tunnel is broad and relatively high in the second and third before the last volution. Chomata are broad and high in the inner four volutions but low and discontinuous in outer volutions. The average tunnel angles of the first to sixth volution are about 12, 11, 15, 23, 32, and 29 degrees, respectively."

        "output": "Assistant: Shell small, inflated fusiform, with sharply to bluntly pointed poles. The lateral slopes are usually convex, but occasionally become slightly concave in the outer whorls. Mature individuals of seven and one-half to eight and one-half volutions measure 2.33 to 3.41 mm in length and 1.71 to 2.42 mm in width. Form ratio normally varies from 1.3 to 1.7, averaging 1.5.\nThe spirotheca is thin. Its thickness in the seventh whorl varies from 36 to 55 microns. The septa are broadly and gently wavy across the middle of the shell, becoming rather strongly but irregularly folded toward the poles.\nThe proloculus is small, its outside diameter ranging from 85 to 137 microns and averaging 109 microns. The tunnel is low and narrow, its height being about one-third that of the chambers. The tunnel angle varies from 10 to 12 degrees in the second whorl, 12 to 13 degrees in the third, 12 to 16 degrees in the fourth, 11 to 18 degrees in the fifth, 11 to 20 degrees in the sixth, and 14 to 17 degrees in the seventh. The chomata are well developed and are one-third to one-half as high as the chambers. In the early whorls, they are broad and extend nearly to the poles; in the outer volutions, their width is reduced to about twice their height."

        "output": "Assistant: The test is constructed with regular fusiform whorls. In some cases the median zone considerably vaulted, the lateral parts sloping smoothly towards the pointed ends. The length is 4.05 mm. the width 1.77 mm.; the proportion of the latter to the former is 1:2.3. The three inner whorls particularly compact, the outer ones moderately loose. The height of the whorl does not perceptibly vary along the direction of the axis.\\nSpirotheca exceedingly thin in the early volutions, becoming a little thicker in the next ones and at the same time very slowly thinning off toward the poles. It measures but 0.04 mm. thick in the last part.\\nSepta almost not fluted in the first three volutions, folding into fairly regular folds in the lower more than 2/3 of the vertical surface in the next two or three coils. In the last few whorls the folding of septa becomes more or less irregular.\\nChomata feebly developed only in the several innermost whorls, disappearing in the outer ones. Two narrow but long axial fillings disposed each in one of the lateral axial regions. The shape and size of the proloculum are not yet clearly made out, but it is probably very small."

        "output": "Assistant: Shell small, rather short, uniformly fusiform. Poles sharply pointed. Mature forms of six volutions are about 3.6 mm. in length and 1.4 mm. in width, and they have a form ratio of 1:2.4 to 1:2.6. The profile of the shell remains very uniform throughout growth of the individual. The lateral slopes are very uniform and even.\nThe septa appear to be only slightly fluted in the extreme polar regions.\nThe proloculum is essentially spherical and its inside diameter measures 95 to 130 microns. The rate of increase of the heights of the volutions is rather uniform. The heights of the chambers in the first five volutions are 34, 60, 78, 104, and 129 microns.\nThe spirotheca is relatively thin. The diaphanotheca is extremely thin in the first volution and it gradually increases in thickness to about 7 microns in the fourth volution, 8.8 in the fifth volution, and 12.2 in the sixth volution.\nThe tunnel is low and wide. In the fifth and sixth volutions it is about one-third as high as the chambers and about six times as wide as high. The tunnel angle is 36\u00b0 to 43\u00b0 in the fifth and sixth volutions. The chomata are well developed and are very asymmetrical. In the fourth and fifth volutions they are about one-half as high as the chambers and are over twice as wide as high."
