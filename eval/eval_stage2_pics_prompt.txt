## Task Description
You will receive input as an fossil image, You need to score that image, where:

- **1** = The image quality is very poor, for reasons such as:

* The shell ring is incomplete, with large white gaps.
* The shell ring is not a complete geometric shape (such as an ellipse, fusiform or spindle shape).
* There is an abnormal indentation on the left or right side of the outermost shell ring.
* Another complete fossil image is included on the left or right side inside the fossil image. (Such as the Example2)
* The axial accumulation (the large black area near the horizontal symmetry axis of the image) exists but does not extend to both sides along the horizontal symmetry axis; instead, it abruptly appears on both sides.
* The folds (the irregular porous structures on the horizontal sides of the image) do not fully fill the outermost shell ring in the vertical direction.
* The image contains only clean concentric geometric shell rings, with no other feature points, except at the horizontal ends.

- **2** = The image quality is average, for reasons such as:

* None of the issues of the 1-point image are clearly present.
* The shell ring is not clear and appears blurry.
* The folds (the irregular porous structures on the horizontal sides of the image) are not distinct.

- **3** = The image quality is good, for reasons such as:

* None of the issues of the 1-point and 2-point images are present.

- **4** = The image is a real fossil image, used to help you understand the above scoring criteria.

## Instructions
1. Analyze the given fossil images.
2. Assign a score (0-3, only integer allowed) based on how well the quality of the unscored image is based on the criteria above.
3. Output a valid JSON object with "reason" and "score" as keys and your reasoning and assigned score as values, respectively.

## Response requirements
First elaborate your analysis and reasoning, then provide the final score, an integer between 1 (worst) and 3 (best). You should put your analysis and reasoning in "reason" part whilst put your final score into "score" part, as the following format suggests:

{"reason": "your reasoning here", "score": 2}

You should not provide user with extra content such as 'Here's the analysis and score for the image:', etc.
