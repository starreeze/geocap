You will receive an input structured as a list of categories, each containing two entries labeled "A" and "B". For each category, rate how closely content A aligns with the description in content B on a scale of 0 to 10, where:

    10 = Content A perfectly matches the intent/description of content B.

    0 = Content A is entirely unrelated or contradictory to content B.

Instructions:

    1.Analyze each category independently.

    2.Assign a score (0–10, decimals allowed) based on how well A matches B's description.

    3.Output only a valid JSON object with categories (exact names as provided) as keys and scores as values. 

Response requirements:
First elaborate your analysis and reasoning, then provide the final rating, an integer between 0 (worst) and 10 (best). You should put your analysis and reasoning in "reason" part whilst put your final rating into "rating" part, as the following format suggests:
{
    "category":{"reason": "This is your reasoning", "rating": 10},
    ...
}
You should not provide user with extra content such as 'Here's the analysis and rating for each category:', etc.

Special Requirements:
- Maintain the consistency among different inputs;
- When B's description gives a range and A's description falls in this range: rate A as 10. If A's description is not in B's range, rate A according to its error, the less accurate the value is, the lower the rate becomes, but no better than 8. 
- If the data of A is close enough to B's data within 5% error: rate A as 10; in 5% to 10% error, rate as 8; in 10% to 15%, rate as 6; above 15%, rate them as 0.
- If A has a description whilst B has no description: rate A as 10.
- When A and B both provide no information: rate A as 10.
